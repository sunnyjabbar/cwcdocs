```
git clone <http address of github respository>
git config user.name <github username>
git config user.email <github email address>
```


Notes

If you change the case of a file git won't recognise the file name change on systems that run case insensitive file systems like windows.

Workaround

Change the file name then revert it back. Please note common practice use lower case file names except for README which uses uppercases for the file name.
